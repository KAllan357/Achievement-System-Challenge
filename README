Completed all code and verified that my unit tests work and print out the appropriate information.

2/1/2011

This is a coding exercise that came from the Riot Games careers website which I navigated to while looking at the game League of Legends. The URL can be found at http://www.riotgames.com/careers/software-engineer-java-pvpnet-platform-los-angeles. The actual document can be found at the URL http://s3.amazonaws.com/riot-HR/Java-Platform_Coding_challenge.doc.

Explanation of Methods

I decided to create an easily extensible DSL (Domain Specific Language) for modeling an Achievement. After writing the initial domain objects, I created an XML interpretation of each Achievement listed in the document. They all accessed a particular property on one of the domain objects, optionally did some math on another property of that object, and compared that against a set constant.

XStream provides an excellent and simple way of creating POJO's from an XML document. Once I could easily create Achievement objects, I created the RuleHandler object for taking those pieces and doing the rule processing. This involves a bit of Java Reflection, to access particular properties on the domain objects. Rule processing also involves a few switch statements and enums to simplify the "Math" and "Comparison" sections of the code.

Installation Instructions

To install...

Execution Instructions

Once downloaded, there are two ways to run the unit tests to see the Achievement results.

From a terminal application, navigate to the downloaded directory where the Maven pom.xml file is located. At the prompt execute $ mvn clean install to build the project and execute the unit tests. The output from CodingChallengeTest should indicate what achievements were earned for which player at the end of a game.

View the CodingChallengeTest inside Eclipse and execute it is a JUnit test. This should print the achievement information to the console of Eclipse.

Improvements

There are still some refinements that could be made to this solution:

* Define an XSD to give a proper outline to what can be appropriate in the DSL for Achievements.
* The RuleHandler could be more robust and may fail in certain XML configurations.
* So far, all achievements are evaluating BigDecimals and the RuleHandler can only handle numbers. If achievements are introduced to compare Strings or other objects, it will fail.
* Implement some more robust error handling and logging (Log4J).
* Some JUnit tests may start to fail as more Achievements are added. It is usually fine for a test to fail, but I may be a bit aggressive in some of my testing.

Example of Output

The Player in this game Shaq earned the following achievements:
Achievement Unlocked! Bruiser: You can really dish out the pain!
Achievement Unlocked! Team Carry: You teach others what its like to deal damage!

The Player in this game Ryan earned the following achievements:
Achievement Unlocked! Bruiser: You can really dish out the pain!
Achievement Unlocked! Sharpshooter: Your aim is tried and true!
