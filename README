This is a coding exercise that came from the Riot Games careers website which I navigated to while looking at the game League of Legends. The URL can be found at http://www.riotgames.com/careers/software-engineer-java-pvpnet-platform-los-angeles. The actual document can be found at the address http://s3.amazonaws.com/riot-HR/Java-Platform_Coding_challenge.doc.

This should be an interesting exercise to practice my Java skills.
